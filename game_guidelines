RULES : http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/
 
 
You can NOT play in an already won square
By default - a square which has ended in a tie game is considered as won by neither players and remains as a void square in the big grid.



DATA FILES FORMAT (Board.dat)

1st 9 lines : 9x9 matrix for the board containing 'X', 'O', '.'
Tenth line : "x y" the grid to play in (x,y=0,1,2) ... any-grid is denoted as "-1 -1"

See attachment

All program files should be in 1 folder only...

All Games start with 'X' as 1st player
O is the capital letter, not the number...
X is the capital letter
. is blank space


so if number of X's = number of O's => X's turn
and if number of X's = number of O's + 1 => O's turn



Win Objective : To win 3 games in a row in the bigger board



Your bot.c will be a separate program (with main function) which will be called from within the engine...

bot executable names must be "bot1" and bot2"
